# 🧠 HR Attrition Analysis – Predictive Model + Dashboard

This project analyzes HR attrition patterns using machine learning and presents actionable insights through a Power BI dashboard.

## 🔍 Objective
- Identify key drivers behind employee attrition
- Predict attrition using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
- Build an interactive dashboard for HR decision-makers

## 📦 Dataset
